Welcome to the AutoCommit App! This Android application connects to GitHub to make quick commits, we can edit files quickly or add a default line in a file and a commit it to maintain the activity

## Key Points

### **Kotlin - JetpackCompose - MVVM**
Used with SOLID Principles and Clean Architecture
### **GitHub API Integration**
With Retrofit and Kotlin Json Serializer
### **Secure Token Storage**: 
Utilizes Security KeyStore with encryption to save GitHub tokens
### **Datastore Persistence**
Basic Settings are kept in DataStore


## Try it!
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/plNav/autocommit.git
   ```

   The app will ask you to introduce your credentials and then is all done!

   > If you have troubles with the GitHubToken check the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
